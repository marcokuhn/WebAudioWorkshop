Your workshop plan is solid and well-structured for beginners! It progressively builds complexity while covering essential Web Audio concepts. Here are my thoughts and suggestions for improvement:

## Strengths of Your Current Plan

1. **Progressive complexity** - Starting with simple oscillator → adding gain → ADSR → MIDI → samples → visualization
2. **Practical examples** - Each example teaches a fundamental concept students will use
3. **Good tech stack** - Tone.js abstracts complexity while Nexus UI provides ready-made controls
4. **Visual feedback** - Ending with p5.js integration makes it engaging and ties audio to visuals

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Time Management for 4.5 Hours
- **First 30-45 min**: HTML/JS basics + Web Audio API concepts (signal flow, nodes)
- **Next 2 hours**: Core examples 1-4 (oscillator progression)
- **Next 1.5 hours**: Examples 5-6 (samples + visualization)
- **Final 30 min**: Q&A, experimentation, troubleshooting

### 2. Add a "Hello World" Example
Before the oscillator, add simple audio file playback via HTML5 `<audio>` tag to give immediate success and show the difference between basic HTML audio and Web Audio API.

### 3. Enhanced Progression

**Recommended order with one addition:**
1. Simple oscillator (pitch control)
2. Oscillator → Gain (volume control)
3. **Oscillator → Filter → Gain** (introduce effects - crucial for signal chain understanding)
4. Oscillator → ADSR → Gain (envelope control)
5. MIDI trigger for ADSR envelope
6. Sample playback with button trigger
7. **Sample with effects** (filter/reverb on the sample)
8. Sample analysis → p5.js visualization

Adding filter control between gain and ADSR teaches the crucial concept of audio effects/processing in the signal chain.

### 4. MIDI Considerations
- **Pre-test MIDI setup** before the workshop (Web MIDI API can be tricky)
- **Have a fallback**: keyboard-triggered notes using computer keyboard (A-S-D-F keys)
- Provide clear device connection instructions beforehand

### 5. Additional Practical Examples to Consider
- **Multiple oscillators** (chord/harmony) - shows how to create richer sounds
- **LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator)** controlling filter cutoff - demonstrates modulation

### 6. Make It Interactive
After sample playback example, have students **load their own audio samples**. This creates personal investment and tests understanding of file loading.

### 7. Visualization Options

For the p5.js section, prepare 2-3 visualization types:
- **Amplitude-based** (circle size, color intensity)
- **Frequency-based** (spectrum analyzer bars)
- **Waveform display** (oscilloscope-style)

This shows different analysis approaches.

## Practical Tips

1. **Provide starter templates** - Pre-made HTML files with commented sections they fill in
2. **Use code snippets** - Have a cheat sheet with common Tone.js patterns
3. **Test all examples** beforehand on lab computers (browser compatibility, audio permissions)
4. **Prepare troubleshooting guide** - Common issues: CORS, autoplay policies, audio context states
5. **Share resources** - Curated list of Tone.js docs, examples, and tutorials for after the workshop

## Optional Advanced Topic

If time permits and students are progressing well, briefly demonstrate **Transport/sequencing** with a simple 4-step sequencer showing how to create patterns. This bridges the gap between single sounds and actual music-making.

Your original plan is excellent! These suggestions mainly add a filter example for better signal chain understanding and ensure smooth pacing for beginners. The progressive learning curve you've established is the right approach.
